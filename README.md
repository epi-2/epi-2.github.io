# **Epilepsy Epidemiology**

## Epilepsy in older adults
Older adults are the fastest-growing population of new cases of epilepsy.
Some cases of epilepsy are due to known stroke or neurodegenerative disease, but some cases have no known cause.

The causes and effects of epilepsy in older adults are still not fully known.

## Epilepsy in special populations
Epilepsy affects people of all ages and all stages of life.
Sex hormones have a complex interaction with seizures and epilepsy, and with epilepsy medications.
Some hormones have excitatory effects at the neuronal membrane and are prone to cause seizures, while others are inhibitory and may reduce seizures. Both endogenous and exogenous hormones can have these effects.  For these reasons, epilepsy in women of childbearing age and in people undergoing gender-affirming medical therapy may have special considerations for treatment.
